# Data Structures and Algorithms Projects

This repository contains 4 projects to implement Data Structures and Algorithms concepts.

### Project 1- Unscramble Computer Science Problems
In this project, you will complete five tasks based on a fabricated set of calls and texts exchanged during September 2016. 
You will use Python to analyze and answer questions about the texts and calls contained in the dataset. 

### Project 2- Show Me the Data Structures
This project covers the foundations of Data Structures including Arrays, Linked Lists, Queues, Recursion, Trees, Maps, and Hashing.

### Project 3- Problems vs. Algorithms
This project covers basic algorithms including Binary Search, Heaps, Tries, Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick, and Heap sort), and Divide and Conquer Algorithms.

### Project 4- Route Planner
This project covers advanced algorithms including Greedy Algorithms, Graph Algorithms, and Dynamic Programming. It utilized the A* Algorithm to create a route planner.
